A historian and ethnologist, I specialize in the cultures of the Northern and Central Caucasus. I'm also a data analyst and visualizer, bridging the gap between the humanities and technical sciences.

Since 2017, I've been running a popular science YouTube channel called "Ethnographica" about the history and culture of the peoples of the North-Western Caucasus. From 2022, I also manage the Telegram channel "Ethnologist's Travel Diary." I am the author of the book "Dances, Mountains, and Chestnut Honey" about the culture and history of the Circassian (Adyghe) people. I've developed and lectured courses such as "Course on the Northern Caucasus: History and Culture" (GetCourse), "Colonial History of Russia," and "History of Ukraine without Propaganda" (educational portal of Svetlana Manakova).

Starting in 2023, I've collaborated with the international project "Europe and the Circassians 1760-1870," initiated by historians from Cambridge and Oxford Universities to collect archival data from various countries around the world. Out of personal interest, I adapt various historical and social data I encounter in my work and studies to digital visualization formats, presenting them beautifully and comprehensibly in charts. This hobby led to the idea of creating this website.
