But what particularly does not please us is the cheapness of sheep: two or three abazi for a sheep, which is 40 or 60 kopecks in silver. Are you surprised? Don't be surprisedâ€”rather, sympathize. Just a couple of weeks ago, I received reliable information that around the Gambo area, 1,200 pigs froze overnight. Imagine what poor shepherds have to do, except driving their herds to Tiflis and selling them at a very low price. What else displeases us is the high cost of firewood. Paying 7 rubles in silver for a cart is heart-wrenching, but do not blame the peasant for selling you fuel at such a high price. He himself is almost at a loss because he is forced to sell his unfortunate buffalo in Tiflis for 12 rubles when it costs him 20 or 25 rubles. Remember that there is no fodder available by the roadsides, and this buffalo might have pulled a heavy cart for two days with frozen wheels through deep snow, arriving in Tiflis hungry and covered in blood!
